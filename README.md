# config

Here's my daily used editor configuration, which is based on `vim`.

It is recommended to swap `ESC` and `Caps Lock` before you continue.



## Design

Most of the keymaps are designed as **enhancements** of the initial `vim` ones.



## Type Fast

Practice with [TypeFast](https://typefast.io/) if you find it difficult to reach `$`, `0`, `*`, or many other keys.
